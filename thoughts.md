ntro to Material Design Homework - Responses


##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/index.html) website design.

1. I don't like that the Developers and Distribute sections have one theme, but the Design and Develop sections have different look to them

2. I don't like the look of the Design and Devlopment sections

3. I like the look of the Developers and Distribute screens

4. I like that the search field is visible from all the screens

5. I like the way the screen bounces down when you scroll past the top, and vice versa when you scroll past the bottom

6. The content on the screens wraps nicely when you shrink the window

7. Related to #6 but in the don't like category, I don't like that when you shrink the screen
		enough, you lose some of the tabs in the top toolbar

8. However, I like that the menu icon on the top left stays when you shrink the screen, 
		so you can still navigate around with an extra clink into the menu

9. I like that the sections of the main screen are broken into blocks of cardview selections with the 
		blocks altering slightly in appearance which keeps it from being too monotonous

10. Navigating in the Distribute section is a little clunky in that you change what you're seeing in the 
		views by opening a view with checkboxes and selecting/deselecting, although I'm thinking tht saves a lot of 
		space and/or keeps us from needing a bunch more screens

##### Write at least 3 reasons why the [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/index.html) website design follows Material Design guidelines. Be as specific as possible.

1.	The views on the main screen (and throughout) show elevation and shadows

2.	There's a palette selection that looks like it follows the colorPirimary, colorPrimaryDark, accentColor framework

3. pulling the screen left or right navigates to the screen in the tab to either right or left... like  the way you can pull a 
		piece of paper off a stack of paper to reveal the one under it.
